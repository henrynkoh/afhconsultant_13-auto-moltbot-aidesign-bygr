<p><strong>Want to become an AFH (Adult Family Home) consultant or advisor in Washington State?</strong> You need a clear path from start to finish: licensing, WABO building compliance, city permits, and the DSHS Initial Inspection Preparation Checklist.</p>

<p>We built a <strong>single complete curriculum and toolset</strong> for prospective consultants, advisors, and concierges. Here’s what’s inside:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Curriculum (8 weeks, 6 modules):</strong> AFH basics, licensing, Building Inspection & WABO (expanded), Initial Inspection Prep, Admin Training, certification.</li>
<li><strong>Drawing Workflow:</strong> Data intake → base plan → validate & edit → 3D conversion (Nano Banana/Gemini) → package PDFs → delivery. DIY permit-ready for city submission.</li>
<li><strong>Moltbot / Clawdbot:</strong> Top 10 CLI commands and 20 drawing prompts for WABO-compliant floor plans, egress, grab bars, 3D.</li>
<li><strong>Top 100 AFH Admin Questions:</strong> Licensing, Building/Safety, Resident Care, Operations. Answers with WAC/RCW citations and reasoning.</li>
<li><strong>City Guides:</strong> Centralia, Lacey, Tumwater, Olympia, Chehalis — permit process, fees, WABO checklist.</li>
<li><strong>Labs & Cost Estimator:</strong> Hands-on labs for Modules 3–5; startup and ongoing cost ranges for 4–6 bed AFH.</li>
</ul>

<p>About <strong>70% of the content</strong> is focused on using Design Agent and Moltbot to automate drawings that meet local building inspector requirements for AFH permits (WABO, <a href="https://www.wabo.org">www.wabo.org</a>).</p>
