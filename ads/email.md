Hi [First Name],

If you’re thinking about becoming an AFH (Adult Family Home) consultant or advisor in Washington State, you need a clear path from start to finish: licensing, WABO building compliance, city permits (Centralia, Lacey, Tumwater, Olympia, Chehalis), and the DSHS Initial Inspection Preparation Checklist.

We built a **single complete curriculum and toolset** for prospective consultants, advisors, and concierges. Here’s what’s inside:

• **Curriculum (8 weeks, 6 modules):** AFH basics, licensing, Building Inspection & WABO (expanded), Initial Inspection Prep, Admin Training, certification.

• **Drawing Workflow:** Six steps—data intake → base plan → validate & edit → 3D conversion (Nano Banana/Gemini) → package PDFs → delivery. DIY permit-ready for city submission without a third-party architect.

• **Moltbot / Clawdbot:** Top 10 CLI commands and 20 drawing prompts for WABO-compliant floor plans, egress, grab bars, 3D.

• **Top 100 AFH Admin Questions:** Licensing, Building/Safety, Resident Care, Operations. Answers with WAC/RCW citations and reasoning.

• **City Guides:** Centralia, Lacey, Tumwater, Olympia, Chehalis — permit process, fees, WABO checklist.

• **Labs & Cost Estimator:** Hands-on labs for Modules 3–5; startup and ongoing cost ranges for 4–6 bed AFH.

About **70%** of the content is focused on using Design Agent and Moltbot to automate drawings that meet local building inspector requirements for AFH permits (WABO, www.wabo.org).
